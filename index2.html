<h1>Brief Practical Crash Course in HTML/CSS</h1>
<small>2020-04-24</small>
<h2>From Bare Bones Page to Online Website</h2>

<p>I wanted to make this webpage for the hobbyists/students/I-avoid-computers-and-code-because-they-are-so-confusing advocates (and specifically future educators who might be interested in having some nice tools in their repertoire) that don't know too much about programming to help them realize, mainly, three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Programming doesn't have to be scary. There's actually a lot of intuition to be found in it once you understand some basics.</li>
<li>Programming can be fun. There's a lot of useful and creative outlets that it can be used for which is why I specifically chose HTML/CSS--Ibelieve it represents the most aesthetic view of writing code.</li>
<li>I suppose this is a derivative of the last point, but programming is an art. This is something I'm still learning, but the deeper you go with it the more you realize there are elements of design, creativity, and exploration in programming.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before I go any further, I want you to know what we're even working with here and <em>why</em>. What is <strong>HTML</strong>? What is <strong>CSS</strong>? And <strong>why do we want to learn them</strong>?</p>

<p>HTML is a convenient acronym (there are A LOT of acronyms in software) for <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong>. I will be referring to this as HTML from hereon out because I'm sane.</p>

<p>Basically, you use HTML to write up what goes on your webpage from text and images to actual areas containing these elements. You can think of the web coder at this point as an artist deciding where his painting should go and what content should go on the canvas.</p>

<p>Broadly, here's what HTML consists of and what you will be seeing later when you get to work with it!</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML is a series of elements that tell an Internet browser how to display your content</li>
<li>Every element is represented by special <strong>tags</strong> which we will get to learn about mroe in-depth later</li>
<li>Tags label the content that you put onto the webpage</li>
</ul>

<p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. Like the title implies, this is the tool we use to style our webpage: CSS designates the overall layout of the HTML elements and what they look like. The web coder as an artist is using his paint strokes and arranging the designs on his painting--however, CSS goes a lot deeper than thsi and there are some increidble designs and layouts you can make of it that you will get to create!</p>

<p>Broadly, here's what CSS consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A wide variety of attributes and characteristics you can apply to your elements (e.g. color, spacing, font size, padding)</li>
<li>We will see this more later: By nature of design, you can inherit of share these characteristics between elements by only having to write a CSS statement once</li>
<li><em>Inline</em>: You style the look and layout of each element individually</li>
<li><em>Internal</em>: You create a special section in your webpage which decides the overall style of your webpage</li>
<li><em>External</em>: You create a special file outside of your HTML document that is connected to it and still styles the HTML elements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>So why learn all of this? We want to make a website! Websites are an awesome way to digitally express something we find of interest whether that's a forum, a blog, or even a personal gallery. In a sense, they are also a means to communicate something between people. Your favorite social media websites like Facebook and Twitter as well as email services like Gmail operate on a lot of the same material that we will be looking at here.</p>

<p>It's obvious that many of the services we use in our daily lives operate as websites and to that end they are incredibly important. But it can be kind of difficult to understand where they come from let alone how to make one yourself. That's why this page exists. I want to show you that it can be a lot more intuitive than you might think. This is also the beginning of you being able to express yourself in a remarkably creative manner where the possibilities are endless. You don't have to be a programmer to understand how to build websites from scratch. </p>

<p><strong><em>As an Educator</em></strong>: Building your own website in HTML and CSS provides you a new means of creating learning opportunities for everyone you mentor. You will also be able to take responsibility for harnessing a new mode of expression and the process of learning can also teach you how you might best fit in different learning environments. As a student, I am very excited to be able to share this with you because I believe technology, when used right, can create a massive, positive impact for public education. </p>

<p>HTML and CSS are the bread and butter of creating a website. There is also a cross platform scripting language called JavaScript which defines the <em>behaviour</em> of a website, but we will focus on HTML and CSS for now because there's already so much you can do with these two tools.</p>

<h3>Our End Goal</h3>

<p>The final goal for this tutorial is to get you to build a personal online portfolio for yourself. I have a few sample images of what the final product will eventually look like for you to see, but you can also check out <a href="example/">the website</a> itself and play around with it.</p>

<p>Our portfolio represents a single page that showcases all of the glorious work we've gathered! You'll notice there are several important components that we will be building for our website: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Welcome Section</em> with our title and a showcase of our lovely visage</li>
<li><em>Navigation Bar</em> with links that move to different sections of the page</li>
<li><em>About Section</em> with a small blurb of who we are</li>
<li><em>Gallery</em> of our "work" with several images that have scroll-over descriptions of our work</li>
<li><em>Contact Section</em> with a dummy form to get into contact with our audience</li>
</ul>

<p>And this is what we're starting with!</p>

<div class="blank-box-container">
    <span class="blank-box"></span>
</div>

<p>That's right. From blank page to a full-fledged online portfolio. Let's get started learning!</p>

<h3>Software Needed</h3>

<p>The software we will be using to build our HTML/CSS project is called <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. Glitch is an interactive programming environment that allows you to edit and run code directly on your internet browser, making it very convenient for our purpose since we can skip and further setup process.</p>

<p>Overall, it's a big time-saver and you can even download your project straight off of the environment when you are done developing! Go ahead and make your way over to <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> and click on <strong><em>New Project</em></strong>, then hit <strong><em>hello-webpage</em></strong> to get started. You should see a couple screens like the ones provided below.</p>

<figure>

<div class="image-container">

<p><img src="img/glitch_home.png" alt="alttext" />
<img src="img/2020-04-16-1587076424_screenshot_943x938.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

</div>

<figcaption>Home screen and project screen once you navigate to 'hello-webpage'</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>You should find a list, or <strong>directory</strong>, of files on the left side of the project screen. Click on <code>index.html</code> as this will be where all of our HTML is going to take place.</p>

<p>Notice that the file extension is <code>.html</code> so this will allow web browsers and computers to process our file as an HTML document! We could actually create a new file on our computer with this extension and it would be processed the same way.</p>

<p>Here's the page you should be seeing:</p>

<figure>

<div class="image-container">

<p><img src="img/glitch_indexpage.jpg" alt="alttext" />

</div>

<figcaption>The 'index.html' page where all our HTML code will be written</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>There are several important components on this page I would like to highlight and will make it easier for you to use the editor.</p>

<figure>

<div class="image-container">

<p><img src="img/glitch_indexpage_edited.png" alt="alttext" /></p>

</div>

<figcaption></figcaption>

</figure>

<ul>
<li>The pink region represents your editor where you will type all of your code</li>
<li>The green region is the <strong><em>Show</em></strong> button which will allow you to preview what your page looks like in the present state of your code</li>
<li>The blue region is your directory list which is a hierarchy of how your files are organized</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if this looks daunting to you, then rest assured, you will come out of this knowing every single bit of what is on the page right now. We're actually going to start of clearing a few parts of the page to get a minimal HTML page running.</p>

<ol>
<li>Highlight all of the text in the editor from <code class="prettyprint">&lt;h1&gt;...</code> on <strong>Line 16</strong> to <code class="prettyprint">&lt;/script&gt;</code> on <strong>Line 25</strong></li>
<li><strong>Backspace</strong> it away!</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Basic, Minimal Structure of HTML</h3>

<p>Right now, you are looking at the bare minimum for an HTML page to run. If you preview your page with the <strong><em>Show</em></strong> button then you should see a blank, white page. If you look up at your tabs, the tab title will be <strong>Hello!</strong>.</p>

<p>So what's going on here? Somehow the code we have written so far is generating this page with a title that is eerily similar to the text written in the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>

<p>Let's break it down piece-by-piece!</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is telling our browser to parse our document as an HTML file</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;html&gt;</code> is an element that will always be the root, or most broad level, of our document</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;head&gt;</code> gives meta information about our webpage like page description, document author, etc. Search engines can use this information to help find our website and it will also contain special scripts we may want to run as well. You won't see this metadata show up on your page, but it can be super useful--there are coders whose entire job is to optimize for search engine relevancy!</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;</code> is a tag for a title element on our webpage which will show up on the tab like was previously mentioned</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;body&gt;</code> tag is where things get interesting for building visual elements since it captures all the visible content that we will provide</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, let's try changing the text in the title tag to <strong>My Portfolio</strong> and writing whatever we want in the area bounded by <code class="prettyprint">&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;</code></p>

<figure>

<h3>Tags and Their Attributes</h3>

<p>We're about to start handling the big work of making our portfolios, but there are a couple more topics that are crucial to understand before we begin.</p>

<p>I've mentioned <strong>tags</strong> a few times and you might be wondering what those are. Tags are essentially labels for our elements, denoted by angle brackets. At this point, you've already seen several appear in our basic document and I'd like for you to get an idea of how to write them as well as a few exampels that we will be using to make our portfolio.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most tags come <em>in pairs</em> with the closing tag containing a <code>/</code>. An example of this is <code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;</code> or <code class="prettyprint">&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;</code></li>
<li>This starting and ending tag formulation will tell the browser where your element section starts and ends with all the content going in-between</li>
</ul>

<p>And here are a few important tags we'll be working with:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code>: A more general and commonly used tag, this defines a general division or section of our HTML document</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code>: A paragraph element. In HTML, you won't be able to change how your text looks the usual way--you can't just add extra spaces or lines in your code--and this tag will help you write the text for browsers</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;a&gt;</code>: The anchor tag supports hyperlinks which will be used to link to other webpages or even a specific area on our own webpage</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;img&gt;</code>: This tag allows you to insert images into your HTML site. You will specify a file name for it to determine which image is displayed</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;form&gt;</code>: This tag will create a form with multiple fields that a user on your website can put information in. This will make up the contact form portion of our portfolio</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to mention that there are many different tags than the ones I've listed and that some of them will come into play in our own project. However, the tags I've listed have the most distinct functions in our project so I've chosen to highlight them.</p>

<p>Let's add two of these elements into our document now. Inside our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;body&gt;</code> element area, we'll add a <code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code> enclosing our text and a <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code> enclosing both of these elements.</p>

<figure>

<div class="image-container">

<p><img src="img/glitch_tagsexplained_1.jpg" alt="alttext" /></p>

</div>

<figcaption>We now have a 'div' and a 'p' tag in our document</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>You won't be seeing any visible changed when you preview your page, but notice how we're actually putting our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag inside of the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code>tag. This is what we call <strong>nesting</strong> and it plays an important part in how our elements interact together, especially as we begin to look at special characteristics of tags called <strong>attributes</strong>.</p>

<h3>Attributes and Nesting</h3>

<p>Conceptually, we can think of all of our elements a as parents, children, and descendants. Our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code> is a <em>parent</em> to the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code> element because we declared it inside of the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. We call this type of relationship <strong>nesting</strong>. In fact, the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code> are both nested inside the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>However, if we were to nest another element inside the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag then it become a <em>descendant</em> of the original <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code>. Our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code> would be a grandparent!</p>

<p>This understanding of relaitonships between elements is especially important as we start getting into <strong>attributes</strong>. Attributes are characteristics we assign to HTML elements inside the opening tag like what images will be displayed by the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, what link or section our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag points towards, or even how we group elements together.</p>

<p>We can insert an image in our document now by adding an <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag like so: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img src=<em>"link"</em> alt=<em>"alt text"</em>&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I will be using a sample image that I will leave for you to download or feel free to download and save your own. Just make sure to upload it to the Glitch <code>assets/</code> folder by clicking on the folder and pressing <strong><em>Upload an Asset</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Sample image: <img src="img/john_dewey.jpg" alt="John Dewey" /></p>

<p>When you upload your image, make sure to copy the URL that displays when you click on your image. This will go inside the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<figure>

<div class="image-container">

<p><img src="img/glitch_attributesexplained_1.jpg" alt="alttext" />
<img src="img/glitch_attributesexplained_2.jpg" alt="alttext" />
<img src="img/glitch_attributesexplained_imgresult.jpg" alt="alttext" /></p>

</div>

<figcaption>Progress of your page so far when uploading an image</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Due to the nature of Glitch, we actually store a copy of our image file on their databases and we use the copied URL to reference the image in the database. However, in an independent project, we could have also referenced the file in our project itself such as <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="An Image"&gt;</code> with our file structure looking like this:</p>

<pre>
project
|   README.md 
|   index.html
|   script.js
|   style.css
|   image.jpg
</pre>

<p>I won't go into much further detail about directories and file structure since that isn't our focus right now. However, I'm hoping you can see HTML attributes at play when we use them in our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. In this case, we are using attributes to specify what image is displayed when we use <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img&gt;</code> in our HTML.</p>

<p>Notice too that our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;img&gt;</code> element is now parents by the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code> element and is a child of it as well alongside our <code class="prettyprint">&lt;p&gt;</code> element. We can also think of the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code> as <em>containing</em> these other elements so that it forms a kind of functional grouping of them. When it comes to styling our page with CSS, we'll use this grouping to our advantage to style multiple sections at once.</p>

<h3>Modeling Our Page with HTML</h3>

<p>Now it's time to dig in deep with creating our very first website in HTML! It might not look pretty at first, but we want to lay out the skeleton for our website before we get into the matter of what colors and styles we want to paint onto it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note: Each designer/developer will have their own preference of workflow. Some may choose to style elements as they go, others may take a more topdown approach of writing out all of their HTML out before getting to the styling. As any developer gains more experience, it's encouraged to try out different approaches to find which one suits you. For now, we'll take the topdown approach.</em></strong></p>
