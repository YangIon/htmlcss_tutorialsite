            <p>
                I wanted to make this webpage for the
                hobbyists/students/I-avoid-computers-and-code-because-they-are-so-confusing advocates (and specifically
                the
                future educators who might be interested in having some nice tools in their repertoire) that don't know
                too
                much
                about programming to help them realize, mainly, three things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming doesn't have to be scary. There's actually a lot of intuition to be found in it once you
                    understand some basics.</li>
                <li>Programming can be fun. There's a lot of useful and creative outlets that it can be used for which
                    is
                    why I specifically chose HTML/CSS--I believe it represents the most aesthetic view of writing code.
                </li>
                <li>I suppose this is a derivative of the last point, but programming is an art. This is something I'm
                    still
                    learning, but the deeper you go with it the more you realize there are elements of design,
                    creativity,
                    and exploration in programming.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Before I go any further, I want you to know what we're even working with here and <i>why</i>. What
                    is
                    <b>HTML</b>? What is <b>CSS</b>? And <b>why do we want to learn them</b>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML is a convenient acronym (there are A LOT of acronyms in software) for <b>Hyper Text Markup
                        Language</b>. I will be referring to this as HTML from hereon out because I'm a sane person.
                </p>
                <p>Basically, you use HTML to write up what goes on your webpage from text and images to actual areas
                    containing these elements. You can think of the web coder at this point as an artist deciding where
                    his
                    painting should go and what content should go on the canvas.</p>
                <p>
                    Broadly, here's what HTML consists of and what you will be seeing later when you get to work with
                    it!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML is a series of elements that tell an Internet browser how to display your content</li>
                    <li>Every element is represented by special <b>tags</b> which we will get to learn about more
                        in-depth
                        later</li>
                    <li>Tags label the content that you put onto the webpage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>. Like the title implies, this is the tool we use to
                    style
                    our webpage: CSS designates the overall layout of the HTML elements and what they look like. The web
                    coder as an artist is using his paint strokes and arranging the designs on his painting--however,
                    CSS
                    goes a lot deeper than this and there are some incredible designs and layouts you can make of it
                    that
                    you will get to create!
                </p>
                <p>Broadly, here's what CSS consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A wide variety of attributes and characteristics you can apply to your elements (e.g. color,
                        spacing, font size, font style)</li>
                    <li>We will see this more later. By nature of design, you can inherit or share these characteristics
                        between elements by only having to write the CSS statement once.</li>
                    <li>Inline CSS: You style the look and layout of each element individually</li>
                    <li>Internal CSS: You create a special section in your webpage which decides the overall style of
                        your
                        webpage</li>
                    <li>External CSS: You create a special file outside of your HTML document that is connected to it
                        and
                        still styles the HTML elements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Motivation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    So why learn all of this? We want to make a website! Websites are an awesome way to digitally
                    express
                    something we find of interest whether that's a forum, a blog, or even a personal gallery. In a
                    sense,
                    they are also a means to communicate something between people. Your favorite social media websites
                    like
                    <b>Facebook</b> and <b>Twitter</b> as well as email services like <b>Gmail</b> operate on a lot of
                    the same material that we
                    will be looking at here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's obvious that many of the services we use in our daily lives operate as websites and to that end
                    they are incredibly important. But it can be kind of difficult to understand where they come from
                    let
                    alone how to make one yourself. That's why this page exists. I want to show you that it can be a lot
                    more intuitive than you might think. This is also the beginning of you being able to express
                    yourself in
                    a remarkably creative manner and I don't exaggerate when I say the possibilities are quite
                    limitless.
                    You don't have to be a programmer to understand how to build websites from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>As an Educator:</b> Building your own website in HTML and CSS provides you a new means of
                    creating learning opportunities for everyone you mentor. You will also be able to take
                    responsibility for harnessing a new mode of expression and the process of learning can also teach
                    you how you might best fit in different learning environments. As a student, I am very excited to be
                    able to share this with you because I believe technology, when used right, can create a massive,
                    positive impact for public education.

                    HTML and CSS are the bread and butter of creating a website. There is also a web programming
                    language
                    called JavaScript which defines the <b>behaviour</b> of a website, but we will focus on HTML and CSS
                    for
                    now because there's already A LOT you can do with these two tools.
