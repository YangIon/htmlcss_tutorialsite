            <h1>Brief Practical Crash Course in HTML/CSS</h1>
            <h2>From Bare Bones Page to Online Website</h2>
            <section class="section0">
                <p>
                    I wanted to make this webpage for the
                    hobbyists/students/I-avoid-computers-and-code-because-they-are-so-confusing advocates (and
                    specifically
                    future educators who might be interested in having some nice tools in their repertoire) that don't
                    know
                    too much about programming to help them realize, mainly, three things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programming doesn't have to be scary. There's actually a lot of intuition to be found in it once
                        you
                        understand some basics.</li>
                    <li>Programming can be fun. There's a lot of useful and creative outlets that it can be used for
                        which
                        is
                        why I specifically chose HTML/CSS--I believe it represents the most aesthetic view of writing
                        code.
                    </li>
                    <li>I suppose this is a derivative of the last point, but programming is an art. This is something
                        I'm
                        still
                        learning, but the deeper you go with it the more you realize there are elements of design,
                        creativity,
                        and exploration in programming.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Before I go any further, I want you to know what we're even working with here and <i>why</i>. What
                    is
                    <b class="term">HTML</b>? What is <b class="term">CSS</b>? And <b>why do we want to learn them</b>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML is a convenient acronym (there are A LOT of acronyms in software) for <b class="term">Hyper Text Markup
                        Language</b>. I will be referring to this as HTML from hereon out because I'm a sane person.
                </p>
                <p>Basically, you use HTML to write up what goes on your webpage from text and images to actual areas
                    containing these elements. You can think of the web coder at this point as an artist deciding where
                    his
                    painting should go and what content should go on the canvas.</p>
                <p>
                    Broadly, here's what HTML consists of and what you will be seeing later when you get to work with
                    it!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML is a series of elements that tell an Internet browser how to display your content</li>
                    <li>Every element is represented by special <b class="term">tags</b> which we will get to learn about more
                        in-depth
                        later</li>
                    <li>Tags label the content that you put onto the webpage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for <b class="term">Cascading Style Sheets</b>. Like the title implies, this is the tool we use to
                    style
                    our webpage: CSS designates the overall layout of the HTML elements and what they look like. The web
                    coder as an artist is using his paint strokes and arranging the designs on his painting--however,
                    CSS
                    goes a lot deeper than this and there are some incredible designs and layouts you can make of it
                    that
                    you will get to create!
                </p>
                <p>Broadly, here's what CSS consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A wide variety of attributes and characteristics you can apply to your elements (e.g. color,
                        spacing, font size, font style)</li>
                    <li>We will see this more later. By nature of design, you can inherit or share these characteristics
                        between elements by only having to write the CSS statement once.</li>
                    <li><em>Inline</em>: You style the look and layout of each element individually</li>
                    <li><em>Internal</em>: You create a special section in your webpage which decides the overall style of
                        your
                        webpage</li>
                    <li><em>External</em>: You create a special file outside of your HTML document that is connected to it
                        and
                        still styles the HTML elements.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="motivation">
                <h3>
                    Motivation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    So why learn all of this? We want to make a website! Websites are an awesome way to digitally
                    express
                    something we find of interest whether that's a forum, a blog, or even a personal gallery. In a
                    sense,
                    they are also a means to communicate something between people. Your favorite social media websites
                    like
                    <em>Facebook</em> and <em>Twitter</em> as well as email services like <em>Gmail</em> operate on a lot of
                    the same material that we
                    will be looking at here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's obvious that many of the services we use in our daily lives operate as websites and to that end
                    they are incredibly important. But it can be kind of difficult to understand where they come from
                    let
                    alone how to make one yourself. That's why this page exists. I want to show you that it can be a lot
                    more intuitive than you might think. This is also the beginning of you being able to express
                    yourself in
                    a remarkably creative manner where the possibilities are endless.
                    You don't have to be a programmer to understand how to build websites from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b><em>As an Educator:</em></b> Building your own website in HTML and CSS provides you a new means of
                    creating learning opportunities for everyone you mentor. You will also be able to take
                    responsibility for harnessing a new mode of expression and the process of learning can also teach
                    you how you might best fit in different learning environments. As a student, I am very excited to be
                    able to share this with you because I believe technology, when used right, can create a massive,
                    positive impact for public education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS are the bread and butter of creating a website. There is also a cross platform
                    scripting
                    language
                    called JavaScript which defines the <em>behaviour</em> of a website, but we will focus on HTML and CSS
                    for
                    now because there's already so much you can do with these two tools.

                <h3>Our End Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    The final goal for this tutorial is to get you to build a personal online portfolio for yourself. I
                    have
                    a few sample images of what the final product will eventually look like for you to see, but you can
                    also
                    check out <a href="example/">the website</a> itself and play around with it.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Our portfolio represents a single page that showcases all of the glorious work we've labored on!
                    You'll
                    notice there are several important components that we will be building for our website:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Welcome Section</em> with our title and a showcase of our lovely visage</li>
                    <li><em>Navigation Bar</em> with links that move to different sections of the page</li>
                    <li><em>About Section</em> with a small blurb of who we are</li>
                    <li><em>Gallery</em> of our "work" with several images that have scroll-over descriptions of our work
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Contact Section</em> with a dummy form to get into contact with our audience</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And this is what we're starting with!
                </p>
                <div class="blank-box-container">
                    <span class="blank-box"></span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    That's right. From blank page to a full-fledged online portfolio. Let's get started learning!

                <h3>Software Needed</h3>
                <p>
                    The software we will be using to build our HTML/CSS project is called <a
                        href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>. Glitch is an interactive programming environment that
                    allows
                    you to edit and run code directly on your internet browser, making it very convenient for our
                    purpose
                    since we can skip any further setup process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, it's a big time-saver and you can even download your project straight off of the
                    environment
                    when you are done developing! Go ahead and make your way over to <a
                        href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>
                    and click on <i><b>New Project</b></i>, then hit <i><b>hello-webpage</b></i> to get started. You
                    should
                    see a couple screens like the ones provided below.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/glitch_home.png">
                        <img src="img/2020-04-16-1587076424_screenshot_943x938.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <figcaption>Home screen and project screen once you navigate to 'hello-webpage'</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    You should find a list, or <b class="term">directory</b>, of files on the left side of the project screen. Click
                    on <code>index.html</code> as this will be where all of our HTML is going to take place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that the file extension is <code>.html</code> so this will allow web browsers and computers
                    to process our file as an HTML document! We could actually create a new file on our computer with
                    this extension and it would be processed the same way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the page you should be seeing:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/glitch_indexpage.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <figcaption>The 'index.html' page where all our HTML code will be written</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    There are several important components on this page I would like to highlight and will make it
                    easier for you to use the editor.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/glitch_indexpage_edited.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                </figure>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pink region represents your editor where you will type all of your code</li>
                    <li>The green region is the <b><i>Show</i></b> button which will allow you to preview what your page
                        looks like in the present state of your code</li>
                    <li>The blue region is your directory list which is a hierarchy of how your files are organized</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even if this looks daunting to you, then rest assured, you will come out of this knowing every
                    single bit of what is on the page right now. We're actually going to start off clearing a few parts
                    of the page to get a minimal HTML page running.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Highlight all of the text in the editor from <code class="prettyprint">&lth1&gt...</code> on
                        <b>Line 16</b> to <code class="prettyprint lang-html">...&lt/script&gt</code> on <b>Line 25</b>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Backspace</b> it away!</li>
                </ol>
                <figure>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/glitch_indexpage_basic.jpg" alt="">

                <h3>The Basic, Minimal Structure of HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    Right now, you are looking at the bare minimum for an HTML page to run. If you preview your page
                    with the <b><i>Show</i></b> button then you should see a blank, white page. If you look up at your
                    tabs, the tab title will be <b>Hello!</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what's going on here? Somehow the code we have written so far is generating this page with a
                    title that is eerily similar to the text written in the <code
                        class="prettyprint">&lttitle&gt ...</code> <code class="prettyprint">&lt/title&gt</code>
                    section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's break it down piece-by-piece!
                    <ul>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code> is telling our browser to
                            parse our document as an HTML file</li>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint">&lthtml&gt</code> is an element that will always be the root, or
                            most broad level, of our document</li>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint">&lthead&gt</code> gives meta information about our webpage like
                            page description, document author, etc. Search engines can use this information to help find
                            your website. You won't see this metadata show up on your page, but it can be super
                            useful--there are coders whose entire job is to optimize for search engine relevancy!</li>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint">&lttitle&gt</code> is a tag for a title element on our webpage
                            which will show up on the tab like was previously mentioned</li>
                        <li>The <code class="prettyprint">&ltbody&gt</code> tag is where things get interesting for
                            building visual elements since it captures all the visible content that we will provide!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    For now, let's try changing the text in the title tag to <b>My Portfolio</b> and writing whatever we
                    want in the area bounded by <code class="prettyprint">&ltbody&gt...&lt/body&gt</code>
                    <figure>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="img/glitch_indexpage_edited2.jpg" alt="">
                            <img src="img/glitch_changetitle_result.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <figcaption>You've made the first modifications to your website!</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h3>Tags</h3>
                    We're about to start handling the big work of making our portfolios, but there's one more thing
                    that's absolutely crucial to understand before we begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've mentioned <b class="term">tags</b> a few times and you might be wondering what those are. Tags are
                    essentially labels for our elements, denoted by angle brackets. At this point, you've already seen
                    several appear in our basic document and I'd like for you to get an idea of how to write them as
                    well as a few examples that we will be using to make our portfolio.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most tags come <b>in pairs</b> with the closing tag containing a <code
                                class="prettyprint">/</code>. An example of this is <code
                                class="prettyprint">&lttitle&gt...&lt/title&gt</code> or <code
                                class="prettyprint">&ltbody&gt...&lt/body&gt</code></li>
                        <li>This starting and ending tag formulation will tell the browser where your element section
                            starts and begins with all the content going in-between</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And here are a few important tags we'll be working with:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint">&ltdiv&gt</code>: A more general and commonly used tag, this defines a
                            division or section of our HTML document</li>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint">&ltp&gt</code>: A paragraph element. In HTML, you won't be able to
                            change how your text looks the usual way--adding extra spaces or lines in your code--and
                            this tag will help you write the text for browsers</li>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint">&ltimg&gt</code>: This tag allows you to insert images into your HTML site. You will specify a file name for it to determine which image is displayed</li>
                        <li><code class="prettyprint">&ltform&gt</code>: This tag will create a form with multiple fields that a user on your website can put information in. This will make up the contact form portion of our portfolio</li>
                    </ul>
                    I want to highlight that there are many different tags than the ones I've mentioned and that some of them will come into play in our own project. However, these tags have the most distinct functions in our project so I've chosen to highlight them.
